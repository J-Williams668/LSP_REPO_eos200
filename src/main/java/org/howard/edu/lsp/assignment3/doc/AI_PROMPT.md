Absolutely—right now ETLPipeline is doing everything with static helpers. To make it more OO, separate responsibilities and inject them into a small orchestrator. That way you can unit-test each piece, swap CSV for a DB later, or add/remove transformations without touching the pipeline.

Here’s a clean, OO refactor you can drop into the same package (names follow standard Java lowerCamelCase for methods).

#1. Define roles (interfaces)

...

#2. CSV extractor and loader

...


#3. Transformations as strategies

Make each transformation a Transformer<Product>. You can compose them so the pipeline is configurable.

...


#4. The orchestrator (no statics, DI-friendly)

...


#5. Make Product transformation-friendly

If your current Product mutates itself via UppercaseName(), etc., consider shifting to an immutable style with “withers.” That makes transformers pure and easier to test.


**Is T in the interfaces a placeholder for a type?**

ChatGPT said:

Yes—T is a type parameter (a placeholder for a real type) used in Java generics.

You declare it on a generic type:

public interface Extractor<T> {
  List<T> extract() throws Exception;
}


Here T means “the type this extractor works with.”

You bind it when implementing/using the interface:

class CsvProductExtractor implements Extractor<Product> { ... }  // T = Product
class DbOrderExtractor implements Extractor<Order>   { ... }    // T = Order


It provides compile-time type safety (no casts) and better APIs
